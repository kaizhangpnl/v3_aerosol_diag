## Historical aerosol burden changes (&) relative to piCTRL

Results shown these figures show: 

- Overall, sulfate/BC/POM burden changes (relative to piCtrl) are all smaller compared to v2. This will have an impact on the anthropogenic forcing, in addition to the aerosol/cloud tuning changes. 
- The volcanic emissions have a large impact on sulfate concentrations not only in the stratosphere, but also in troposphere.
- Large changes in BC/POM burdens in the tropics, which indicates much stronger wet removal by convective clouds.
